A recursive Mandelbrot fractal generator for Macbooks in C using SDL for graphics. 

Currently:
* Basic "zoom in" available by selecting a area using the touchpad. Zoom out via CMD-z (osx undo)
* "Zoom In" preserves aspect ratio.
* Simple 16 color palette. No smoothing, lots of ugly banding.
* Uses naive escape time calculations (will eat CPU)
* Depends on platform resolution of float/double. "Infinite precision" to come later.
